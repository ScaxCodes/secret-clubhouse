# 🕵️‍♂️ Secret Clubhouse

In this project, I built a private clubhouse where members can post anonymously. Outside visitors can read the stories, but they don’t see who wrote them - only members inside the clubhouse can see the authors behind each post.

The app focuses on **user authentication** and **session handling**, building on what I learned in previous projects. It also gave me a chance to deepen my skills with **PostgreSQL databases** and server-side logic using **Express** and **Passport.js**.
